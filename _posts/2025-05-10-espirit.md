This post summarizes the [ESPIRiT](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.24751) algorithm for estimating coil sensitivies in MRI. It took me months to grasp the theory behind it.<!--more-->

## A short introduction
MRI is a common imaging technique for medical diagnosis nowadays. It's nearly harmless for humans in contrast to other radioactive imaging techniques. In MRI, when a patient is exposed to a magnetic field, hydrogen atoms align with the field. This alignment could be disrupt by a radiofrequency pulse. As the atoms return to their original alignment, they emit signals captured by sensors and used to create medical images.

The signals captured by a sensor $c$ (or coil $c$) can be approximately formulated as:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y_c(\vec{k}(t)) = \int x(\vec{r}) B_{c}(\vec{r}) e^{-i 2 \pi \vec{k}(t)\cdot\vec{r}}d\vec{r}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $x(\vec{r})$ is an unkown tissue value at location $\vec{r}$, $B_{c}(\vec{r})$ is some value related to the receiver coil $c$, often named as coil sensitivities, $\vec{k}(t)$ is k-space coordinates along with the time $t$.  It's common to have dozens of coils in clinical settings.

This formula indicates that the signals captured by the coil $c$ are fourier transform of interested tissue values which are multipled by the sensitivity map of the coil $c$.  A concise way of the above formula is to represent it with operators:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y_c = \mathcal{F}\mathcal{S}_cx
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes fourier transform, $\mathcal{S}_c$ denotes the sensitivity map of the coil $c$, $y_c$ and $x$ are both vectorized.

Most of the time, coil sensitivities are not available beforehand. We have to estimate them from acquired signals. ESPIRiT is such a method for estimating coil sensitivities , supported by soild theoretical analysis. 

## About GRAPPA
Before diving into ESPIRiT, it's important to first understand GRAPPA, a well-established parallel imaging method used in MRI. The core of GRAPPA is to interpolate missing k-space points by linearly weighting neighboring acquired points, with the weighting coefficients determined from the calibration region.

![grappa]({% link /assets/img/grappa.jpeg %})

Again, a concise way to describe GRAPPA is using operators:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
x_c(r) = (\mathcal{P}_{k}\mathcal{R}_ry)^T \mathbf{g}_{c}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $y$ represents the vectorized multicoil k-space data with unacquired data set to zero, $x_c(r)$ is the estimated value for coil $c$ at location $r$ (for simplicity, the vector notation is omitted, but keep in mind that $r$ is a discrete spatial vector index),  $\mathbf{g}_c$ denotes weighting coefficients for coil $c$, $\mathcal{R}_r$ is a patch operator that selects a local block of data around location $r$ and $\mathcal{P}_k$ is a sampling operator that selects only the acquired points within the patch (the subscript $k$ implies that  there may exist many sampling patterns).

We can easily construct linear equations using the data from the calibration region, with the same undersamping pattern  $\mathcal{P}_k$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{y}_c^{AC} = \mathbf{A}\mathcal{P}_k^T\mathbf{g}_c
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mathbf{y}_c^{AC}$ denotes the vectorized data in the calibration region, $\mathbf{A}$ is a so-called calibration matrix, that each row is a local patch around the current acquired point. In this case, $\mathbf{g}_c$ can be efficiently solved by many numerical methods.

By construction , one of the columns of $\mathbf{A}$ is actually $\mathbf{y}_c^{AC}$ itself. Write this as $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}_c = \mathbf{y}_c^{AC}$, where $\mathbf{e}_c$ is a vector with 1 in the appropriate location to select the corresponding column of $\mathbf{A}$. We note that:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{A}\mathcal{P}_k^T\mathbf{g}_c - \mathbf{y}_c^{AC} &= 0\\
\mathbf{A}\mathcal{P}_k^T\mathbf{g}_c - \mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}_c &= 0\\
\mathbf{A}(\mathcal{P}_k^T\mathbf{g}_c - \mathbf{e}_c) &= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The existence of null-space implies redundancy in row-space of $\mathbf{A}$. $\mathbf{g}_c$ in GRAPPA are very specific null-space vectors. Instead of using this specific form, ESPIRiT analyzes the calibration matrix $\mathbf{A}$ directly. 

## Key assumptions in ESPIRiT
Since the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is constructed using local patches in the calibration region, ESPIRiT assumes that all patches, whether in the calibration region or not, lie in the row-space of $\mathbf{A}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{V}_{\perp}^T\mathcal{R}_r \mathbf{x} &= \mathbf{0}, \quad \forall r
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\mathbf{V}_{\perp}$ is the basis that spans the null-space and $\mathbf{x}$ is the vectorized multicoil k-space data. Note that "lying in the row-space" is equivalent to being orthogonal to the null-space.

> I wrote the formula as $\mathbf{V}_{\perp}^H\mathcal{R}_r \mathbf{x}$, following the same notation used in the paper. However, this ultimatley leads to an algorithm that conflicts with most correct implementations, which require **flipping the kernels** before applying the Fourier transform. Neither the paper nor subsequent research discussed this operation in detail. This confused me for months and it was truly frustrating.
>
> I think the mismatch arises from how we handle the inner product of complex vectors. The rows of the matrix A are flattened row vectors extracted from local patches $(\mathcal{R}_r \mathbf{x})^T$. However, the standard Hermitian inner product is defined for column vectors. That's to say, we should use compute the inner product of $\mathbf{V}\_{\perp}$ and $((\mathcal{R}\_r \mathbf{x})^T)^H$ which is $(\mathbf{V}\_{\perp}^T\mathcal{R}\_r \mathbf{x})^*$ instead of $\mathbf{V}\_{\perp}^H\mathcal{R}\_r \mathbf{x}$ from the original paper. The conjugate symbol can be discarded.

$\mathbf{V}_{\perp}$ is computed by singular value decomposition of $\mathbf{A}$:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{A} &= \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma} \mathbf{V}^H\\
&= \mathbf{U} \mathbf{\Sigma}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{V}_{\parallel} & \mathbf{V}_{\perp}
\end{bmatrix}^H
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
where $\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}$ corresponds to non-zero singular values and $\mathbf{V}_{\perp}$ corresponds to zero singular values.
</p>

Solving the nullspace constraint in the least-square framework

$$
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmin}{arg\,min}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\argmin_{\mathbf{x}} \quad \sum_{r} \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{V}_{\perp }^T \mathcal{R}_r \mathbf{x}\|_F^2
\end{split}
\label{eq:9}
\end{equation}
$$

which leads to the following equations by zeroing out the gradient:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_r \mathcal{R}_r^H\left(\mathbf{V}_{\perp}\mathbf{V}_{\perp}^H\right)^*\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
Since $\mathbf{V}$ is unitary, we have $\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{V}_{\perp}\mathbf{V}_{\perp}^H + \mathbf{V}_{\parallel}\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}^H$. By substituting into the above equations, we get:
</p>

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_r \mathcal{R}_r^H\left(\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}^H\right)^*\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x} = \sum_r \mathcal{R}_r^H\mathcal{R}_r \mathbf{x}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The effect of $\mathcal{R}_r^H\mathcal{R}_r$ is to restore the patch to its original location while zeroing out others elements. The overall effect of $\sum_r \mathcal{R}_r^H\mathcal{R}_r$ is a diagonal matrix, where each diagonal element equals to $M$, indicating the number of times it appears in the neighboring patches. With $M$, the equation can be transformed to:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
M^{-1}\sum_r \mathcal{R}_r^H\left(\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}^H\right)^*\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x} =  \mathbf{x}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

which is equation (\ref{eq:9}) in the paper except for the conjugation.

## "Obvious" convolution
<p>
The most challenging part for me is to derive equation (16) $\mathcal{G}_q \vec{s}_q = \vec{s}_q$ from the paper. The authors mentioned that the operator $\mathcal{W} = M^{-1}\sum_r \mathcal{R}_r^H\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}^H\mathcal{R}_r$ (in our case, $\mathcal{W} = M^{-1}\sum_r \mathcal{R}_r^H\left(\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}^H\right)^*\mathcal{R}_r$) is a matrix-valued convolution, which can be decoupled into point-wise matrix operations in the image domain. The sensitivity maps are obtained by the eigenvalue decomposition of all $\mathcal{G}_q$'s choosing only the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue "=1". 
</p>

The intutive is that we could use the **Fourier Convolution Theorem** to get what we want, which is more straightforward in scalar cases. However, since $\mathcal{W}$ is a high-dimensional operator (k-space locations and channels), applying the theorem directly is not straightforward. A better approach would be to transform $\mathcal{W}$ into a form that resembles something familiar in 1D.

To simplify the derivation, we first introduce some notations:
- $\mathbf{P} =\left(\mathbf{V}\_{\parallel}\mathbf{V}\_{\parallel}^H\right)^*$: $\mathbf{P}$ operates on patches
- $\mathbf{P}\_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)}$: a scalar value, where $(c,\alpha)$ represents the c-th channel and location $\alpha$ in the output (row index), and $(d, \beta)$ represents the $d$-th channel and location $\beta$ in the input (column index)
- $\mathbf{x}\_c(r)$: a scalar value, where $c$ represents the $c$-th channel and $r$ reprsents location $r$ in the k-space
- $(\mathcal{R}\_r\mathbf{x})\_{(d, \beta)}$: a scalar value, the $d$-th coil value at location $\beta$ in the patch centered at location $r$
- $(\mathbf{P}\mathcal{R}\_r\mathbf{x})\_{(c,\alpha)}$: a scalar value, the $c$-th coil value at location $\alpha$ of the output
- $(\mathcal{R}\_r^H\mathbf{P}\mathcal{R}\_r\mathbf{x})\_c(m)$: a scalar value, the $c$-th coil value at location $m$ in the k-space

As we have discussed above, $\mathcal{R}_r$ extracts a patch centered at location $r$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x})_{(d,\beta)}=\mathbf{x}_d(r+\beta)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\beta$ represents the relative shift with respect to the central location $r$.

The effect of $\mathbf{P}$ is to perform a weighted summation across the channels and locations of the input:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\mathbf{P}\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x})_{(c,\alpha)} &= \sum_{d,\beta}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)} (\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x})_{(d,\beta)}\\
&= \sum_{d,\beta}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)}\mathbf{x}_d(r+\beta)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The effect of $\mathcal{R}_r^H$ is to restore the patch to its original location while zeroing out others elements:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\mathcal{R}_r^H\mathbf{P}\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x})_c(m) &= \sum_{\alpha} \delta(m, r+\alpha)(\mathbf{P}\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x})_{(c,\alpha)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\delta(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the Kronecker delta function, which plays an important role in eliminating the inner $\alpha$.

With these notations, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\mathcal{W}\mathbf{x})_c(m) &= M^{-1}\sum_r (\mathcal{R}_r^H\mathbf{P}\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x})_c(m)\\
&= M^{-1}\sum_r\sum_{\alpha} \delta(m, r+\alpha)(\mathbf{P}\mathcal{R}_r\mathbf{x})_{(c,\alpha)}\\
&= M^{-1}\sum_r\sum_{\alpha} \delta(m, r+\alpha)\sum_{d,\beta}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)}\mathbf{x}_d(r+\beta)\\
&=M^{-1}\sum_{\alpha,d,\beta}\sum_r\delta(m, r+\alpha)\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)}\mathbf{x}_d(r+\beta)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Since $\delta(m,r+\alpha) = 1$ if and only if $m=r+\alpha$, we further have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\mathcal{W}\mathbf{x})_c(m) &= M^{-1}\sum_{\alpha,d,\beta}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)}\mathbf{x}_d(m - (\alpha-\beta))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Let $u=\alpha - \beta$ represents the difference between the relative shifts, then:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\mathcal{W}\mathbf{x})_c(m) &= M^{-1}\sum_{d} \sum_u (\sum_{\alpha,\beta,\alpha - \beta= u}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)})\mathbf{x}_d(m - u)\\
&=M^{-1}\sum_{d} \sum_u \mathbf{K}_{c,d}(u)\mathbf{x}_d(m - u)
\end{split}
\label{eq:18}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
where $\mathbf{K}_{c,d}(u) = \sum_{\alpha,\beta,\alpha - \beta= u}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)}$. Recall that $u$ is determined by the relative shifts of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. What we are doing here is actually re-grouping the pairs $(\alpha, \beta)$ according to their common difference $u$.  We don't need to worry about how to compute $\mathbf{K}_{c,d}(u)$ right now; we only need to understand that it is a scalar value associated with $c,d$ and the difference $u$.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we got something that looks like a convolution. $\sum_u \mathbf{K}_{c,d}(u)\mathbf{x}_d(m - u)$ is a convolution of $\mathbf{K}_{c,d}(m)$ and $\mathbf{x}_d(m)$. It's worth noting that $u$ cannot exceed twice the size of the patch, as it represents the difference between the relative shifts. $\mathbf{K}_{c,d}(m)$ is only meaningful in this range.
</p>

## Calculate coil sensitivies
<p>
We should know that $\mathbf{x}_c(m)=\mathcal{F}[\mathbf{s}_c(n)\hat{\mathbf{x}}(n)](m)$, as we have discussed in the introduction. Let's add it to the right-hand side of the equation:
</p>

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\mathcal{W}\mathbf{x})_c(m) &= \mathbf{x}_c(m)\\
M^{-1}\sum_{d} \mathbf{K}_{c,d}(m) \ast\mathbf{x}_d(m) &= \mathbf{x}_c(m)\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Apply the inverse Fourier transform on both sides:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
M^{-1}\sum_{d} \hat{\mathbf{K}}_{c,d}(n)\mathbf{s}_d(n)\hat{\mathbf{x}}(n) &= \mathbf{s}_c(n)\hat{\mathbf{x}}(n)\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}(n)$ is in image-space, $\mathbf{s}_d(n)$ is the $d$-th coil sensitivity value at the location $n$. With all coils at the location $n$, we have:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
M^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf{K}}_{1,1}(n) & \cdots & \hat{\mathbf{K}}_{1,N_c}(n)\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
\hat{\mathbf{K}}_{N_c,1}(n) & \cdots & \hat{\mathbf{K}}_{N_c,N_c}(n)\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{s}_1(n)\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{s}_{N_c}(n)\\
\end{bmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf{x}}(n) &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{s}_1(n)\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{s}_{N_c}(n)\\
\end{bmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf{x}}(n)
\end{split}
\label{eq:21}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{x}}(n)$ can be eliminated if it is non-zero. 

Now it's clear that the coil sensitivities at location $n$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues equal to 1. 

The remaining question is what the inverse Fourier transform of $\hat{\mathbf{K}}_{c,d}(n)$ is:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{\mathbf{K}}_{c,d}(n) &= \frac{1}{N}\sum_m \mathbf{K}_{c,d}(m) e^{i2\pi\frac{nm}{N}}\\
&= \frac{1}{N} \sum_m \sum_{\alpha,\beta,\alpha - \beta= m}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)} e^{i2\pi\frac{nm}{N}}\\
&= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\alpha,\beta}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)} e^{i2\pi\frac{n(\alpha-\beta)}{N}}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
where $N$ is the number of spatial locations. Here we eliminate $m$ by re-grouping elements according to the $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Recall that $\mathbf{P} =\left(\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}^H\right)^*$:
</p>

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)} &= \sum_k \mathbf{v}_k^*(c,\alpha)\mathbf{v}_k(d,\beta)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
where $\mathbf{v}_k(c,\alpha)$ represents a scalar value of the coil $c$ and location $\alpha$ of the $k$-th component of $\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}$.  Then we have:
</p>

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\hat{\mathbf{K}}_{c,d}(n)
&= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\alpha,\beta}\mathbf{P}_{(c,\alpha), (d, \beta)} e^{i2\pi\frac{n(\alpha-\beta)}{N}}\\
&= N \sum_k \left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{\alpha} \mathbf{v}_k^*(c, \alpha)e^{i2\pi\frac{n\alpha}{N}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{\beta} \mathbf{v}_k(d, \beta)e^{-i2\pi\frac{n\beta}{N}}\right)\\
&= N \sum_k \hat{\mathbf{v}}_k(c, n)\hat{\mathbf{v}}_k^*(d, n)
\end{split}
\label{eq:24}
\end{equation}
$$

where $\hat{\mathbf{v}}_k(c, n)$ is the inverse Fourier transform of the conjugated $\mathbf{v}_k(c, m)$ at the location $n$. 

Substituting equation (\ref{eq:24}) into equation (\ref{eq:21}):

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{G}_n \mathbf{G}_n^H
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{s}_1(n)\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{s}_{N_c}(n)\\
\end{bmatrix}
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{s}_1(n)\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{s}_{N_c}(n)\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

<p>
where $\mathbf{G}_n = M^{-1/2}N^{1/2}\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{\mathbf{v}}_1(1, n) & \cdots &  \hat{\mathbf{v}}_{N_k}(1, n)\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
\hat{\mathbf{v}}_1(N_c, n) & \cdots & \hat{\mathbf{v}}_{N_k}(N_c, n)\\
\end{bmatrix}$.
</p>

Let's summarize the steps to compute coil sensitivities:
1. Reshape $\mathbf{V}_{\parallel}$ to the shape $M \times N_c \times N_k$
2. Center it and pad it to the full-grid size $N \times N_c \times N_k$
3. Apply the inverse Fourier transform on the conjugated k-space kernels
4. Extract $\mathbf{G}_n$ of shape $N_c \times N_k$ for each pixel $n$
5. Compute eigenvectors of $\mathbf{G}_n\mathbf{G}_n^H$
6. Select the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of 1, which represent the coil sensitivities at pixel $n$
7. Repeat 4 to 6 until all pixels have been processed

## Connections to the "kernel flippling" operation
Most implementations would do the following kernel flipping operation before applying the Fourier transform:
```matlab
KERNEL = zeros(imSize(1), imSize(2), size(kernel,3), size(kernel,4));
for n=1:size(kernel,4)
    KERNEL(:,:,:,n) = (fft2c(zpad(conj(kernel(end:-1:1,end:-1:1,:,n))*sqrt(imSize(1)*imSize(2)), ...
        [imSize(1), imSize(2), size(kernel,3)])));
end
```

Instead, our algorithm suggests that:
```matlab
KERNEL = zeros(imSize(1), imSize(2), size(kernel,3), size(kernel,4));
for n=1:size(kernel,4)
    KERNEL(:,:,:,n) = (ifft2c(zpad(conj(kernel)*sqrt(imSize(1)*imSize(2)), ...
        [imSize(1), imSize(2), size(kernel,3)])));
end
```

By using the shift properties of the Fourier transform, We can show that:

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
ifft(ifftshift(x))[m] = e^{i2\pi \frac{m}{N} (2\lceil N/2\rceil -1)} fft(ifftshift(x^*_{rev}))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

where $x^*_{rev}$ is the conjugate of the reversed signal $x$. If $N$ is odd, our implementation is equivalent to the kernel flipping operation. However, if $N$ is even, there exists a linear phase term $e^{-i2\pi \frac{m}{N}}$ between the two methods.

I am still investigating the differences between the two methods. However, based on the assumptions in the original paper, I ended up with algorithmic steps that, for unknown reasons, do not match those in other offical implementaions such as bart.

I believe [Professor Haldar's linear-predictability framework](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37478037/) may help explain the discrepancy here. In that work, the authors present a connection between ESPIRiT and the nullspace algorithm direclty, but without providing a proof. Surprisingly, one of their acceleration techniques(Section IV, Part C) is quite similar to my relative shift trick in equation (18). I plan to explore the underlying mathematical relationships in my following posts.
