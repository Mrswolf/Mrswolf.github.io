I received my Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Tianjin University in 2022. I currently works as an engineer in industry while also conducting independent research. My research interests include brain-computer interfaces, magnetic resonance imaging, medical image processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence.
